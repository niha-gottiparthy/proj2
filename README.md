## Idea: 

There is no doubt that people often go crazy when it comes to animals here at Cal. Whether it’s a dog-sitting request on free-and-for-sale, or a stress-relief event with puppy meet-and-greets, students adore everything about our furry friends. As a means to further encourage stress-relief and relaxation time for students, here is an application whose sole purpose is for students to share random photos of their beloved pet puppies or dogs for everyone else to enjoy because who doesn’t love a spontaneous pet photo to start off the day. Users will be able to post photos as well as like/comment on each other’s photos. The photo with the highest amount of likes will be featured at the top of everyone’s feed (Top Dog of the Day).
